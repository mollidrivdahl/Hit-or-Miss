# Hit-or-Miss
This repository contains the code for a game I made in my Intro to OOP course at Oregon Tech (Fall 2015 - Sophomore Year).

<b>Game Description:</b><br />
The purpose of the game is to use the up arrow key to shoot a rectangle upward while a square moves horizontally across the screen. If the rectangle hits the square, then the player wins the game. If the rectangle is shot 3 times and the square still isn't hit by the rectangle, then the player loses the game.<br />

<b>Technologies:</b><br />
This program was written in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. Additionally, the third-party SDL 2.0 library was installed and used in the program to provide a GUI for working with C++.<br />

<b>Execution Instructions:</b><br />
To run this program, one must open this project in Visual Studio and "Start Without Debugging." Please note that the SDL 2.0 library must be installed on the machine and Visual Studio must be told where to find the SDL include directories and SDL library directories.<br />
